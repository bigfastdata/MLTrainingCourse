One has a good prize, two have a bad prize (goat?). You choose one:\n\n![Monte Hall Step 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Monty_open_door.svg/220px-Monty_open_door.svg.png)\n\nThen the host reveals one door with two assumptions:\n\n1) The Host will NOT reveal the door you chose first\n2) The Host will NOT reveal the prize\n\nThe host then asks if you want to keep your original door choice, or switch to the remaining door. This is your final choice and you will get the prize (or goat) behind your final decision. What choice should you make to maximize your probability of winning the prize?\n\n![Monte Hall Step 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Monty_Hall_Problem_-_Standard_probabilities.svg/330px-Monty_Hall_Problem_-_Standard_probabilities.svg.png)\n\nLet's prove the Monte Hall solution using Monte Carlo (no relation):","metadata":{},"id":"2f5ebf2f-357f-4162-8fdd-bea1dd0e0ca0"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import random\n\n# Let D = number of doors in the game\nD=3\n\n# Let us run these many trials (large number for sufficient statistics)\nTRIALS=5000\n\n# These will be our two strategies\nSWITCH_STRATEGY=True\nSTAY_STRATEGY=False\n\n# Define a single instance/execution of the game\ndef monteHallGame(strategy):\n    # Create D Doors\n    door_list = [x+1 for x in range(D)]\n    # Place the Prize\n    door_with_prize = random.randint(1, D)\n    # Choose first door\n    door_I_choose  = random.randint(1, D)\n    # Remove all but two doors keeping with the rules of the game\n    remaining_doors_list = [door_I_choose]\n    if door_I_choose == door_with_prize:\n        remaining_doors_list.append(random.randint(1, D))\n    else:\n        remaining_doors_list.append(door_with_prize)\n        \n    if strategy == SWITCH_STRATEGY: \n        # If switching, remove my door from choices\n        remaining_doors_list.remove(door_I_choose)\n        # Then my final choice is the remaining door\n        door_I_choose = remaining_doors_list[0] \n                \n    # return True (1) if we chose the prize\n    return door_with_prize == door_I_choose\n\n# Manage multiple independant expirements of the game\ndef monteCarlo(strategy):\n    winCount = 0\n    for i in range(TRIALS):\n        winCount += monteHallGame(strategy) \n    return winCount\n\n\nswitch_wins = monteCarlo(SWITCH_STRATEGY)\nstay_wins   = monteCarlo(STAY_STRATEGY)\n\nprint('Results with %s doors and %s trials' % (D,TRIALS))\nprint('Proportion of wins without switching: {:.2f}%'.format(100.0*stay_wins/TRIALS))\nprint('Proportion of wins with switching: {:.2f}%'.format(100.0*switch_wins/TRIALS))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Results with 3 doors and 5000 trials\nProportion of wins without switching: 32.58%\nProportion of wins with switching: 77.78%\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"61d11853-b944-44ab-96f2-7aa1c14b62f2"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"... but if you still don't believe it, here are some different perspectives:\n\n* From the movie '21': ['21' Movie depiction of Monte Hall](https://youtu.be/iBdjqtR2iK4)\n* My favorite [explination by Numberphile](https://youtu.be/4Lb-6rxZxx0)\n* A less mathmatical by very historical view [as explained by Vox](https://youtu.be/ggDQXlinbME)\n* An entertaining [explination by VSauce](https://youtu.be/TVq2ivVpZgQ) ... this guy is weird.","metadata":{},"id":"d42887d9-0a14-42e3-a9ef-dc31579f1ff1"}]}
